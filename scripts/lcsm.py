# A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of every member
# of the collection. We say that a common substring is a longest common
# substring if there does not exist a longer common substring. For example,
# "CG" is a common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA", but it is not as
# long as possible in this case, "CGTA" is a longest common substring of
# "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA".

# Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily unique for a simple
# example, "AA" and "CC" are both longest common substrings of "AACC" and
# "CCAA".

# Given: A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each in
# FASTA format.

# Return: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple solutions
# exist, you may return any single solution.)
