    Finding a Shared Motif

    A common substring of a collection of strings is a substring of every
    member of the collection. We say that a common substring is a longest
    common substring if there does not exist a longer common substring. For
    example, "CG" is a common substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA", but it
    is not as long as possible in this case, "CGTA" is a longest common
    substring of "ACGTACGT" and "AACCGTATA".

    Note that the longest common substring is not necessarily unique for a
    simple example, "AA" and "CC" are both longest common substrings of "AACC"
    and "CCAA".

    Given: A collection of k (kâ‰¤100) DNA strings of length at most 1 kbp each
    in FASTA format.

    Return: A longest common substring of the collection. (If multiple
    solutions exist, you may return any single solution.)
